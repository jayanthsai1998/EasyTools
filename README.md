Easy Tools
==============


Python's ``itertools`` library is a gem - you can compose elegant solutions
for a variety of problems with the functions it provides. In ``easy-tools``
we collect additional building blocks, recipes, and routines for working with
Python iterables.

----


Getting started
===============

To get started, install the library with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install easy-tools

The recipes (modules/functions) included in this package are: 

+---------------------------+
| doublet_occurrence        |
+---------------------------+
| triplet_occurrence        |
+---------------------------+
| equilibrium_point         |
+---------------------------+
| non_divisible_subset_len  |
+---------------------------+
| leaders_to_left           |
+---------------------------+
| divisible_pairs           |
+---------------------------+
| leaders_to_right          |
+---------------------------+
| largest_number_possible   |
+---------------------------+


For example,

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from easy_tools import largest_number_possible
    >>> iterable = [98, 9, 26]
    >>> largest_number_possible(iterable)
    99826




You can use help function to get the detailed description of a function.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> help(function_name)
