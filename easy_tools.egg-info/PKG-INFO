Description: ==============
        Easy Tools
        ==============
        
        
        Python's ``itertools`` library is a gem - you can compose elegant solutions
        for a variety of problems with the functions it provides. In ``easy-tools``
        we collect additional building blocks, recipes, and routines for working with
        Python iterables.

        Getting started
        ===============
        
        To get started, install the library with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            pip install easy-tools
        
        The recipes (modules/functions) included in this package are:
        	.triplet_occurrence
        	.doublet_occurrence
        	.equilibrium_point
        	.non_divisible_subset_len
        	.leaders_to_left
        	.leaders_to_right
        	.largest_number
        
        
        For example,
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> from easy_tools import largest_number
            >>> iterable = [98, 9, 26]
            >>> largest_number(iterable)
            99826
        
        
        
        
        You can use help function to get the detailed description of a function.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> help(function_name)
